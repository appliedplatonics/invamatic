=== What's Invamatic

Invamatic is a rails-based application for keeping track of
electronics parts inventory at Applied Platonics, including:

* The ability to have multiple suppliers for each "item" in your inventory
* The ability to create "kits" of "items" in your inventory
* A set of translation tools for invoices from common suppliers
* A utility to compute the cost of a kit given the average cost of the parts you have on-hand
* A utility to compute how many units of a given kit can be kitted up right now

There should probably be a web UI, what with it being a rails project
and all, but that's not really something that's come up at AP.  Sorry
folks.

=== About this release

There is precious little user documentation here; consider this a
developers-only release.  It's mostly a fast touchup of what AP uses
internally after people were looking for something like it on a
mailing list.

=== Support

For any and all support issues, please see your local supplier of
sacrificial chickens.  I'm happy to help people who are helping
themselves, but, unfortunately don't have any time to offer much
support.  I will happily consider pull requests, though, especially if
you're interested in adding a web UI for people who aren't as
horrifically CLI-oriented as myself.
